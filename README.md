A simple Task Tracker CLI-driven program

The program is finished. Every task you add are placed by default in the pending list.

You can update, delete, mark as Pending, In-Progress or Completed, list all the tasks and save to a JSON file.

I got this project from Roadmap.sh (https://roadmap.sh/projects/task-tracker)
